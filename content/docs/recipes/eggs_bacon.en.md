# Eggs and Bacon

This is my favourite breakfast. I have it almost every day.

## Ingredients

* 50 g bacon (4-5 slices)
* 3 eggs (mid-size)

## Procedure

Fry 4 to 5 slices of bacon in a large pan. Use high heat first (7/10) but reduce it soon to (5.5/10). Put the bacon on the serving plate. Break three eggs onto the pan. They will nicely fry on the residual bacon fat. Do not stir, wait several minutes until they are fried. Bacon is quite salty, no need to salt them.

### Occasional extras

* Rosemary (sprinkled over the bacon and eggs while frying)
* Caraway
* Pepper
* Coriander (dress the plate)
* Leek (sprinkled over the eggs)
